# wasteWaterChallenge
Some code related to the [MINO challenge 2016](http://www.mino-itn.unibo.it/challenge-2016).

---
This is a parser for the instances of the challenge in form of a python notebook. There is a loop over
the .txt files in the instances folder that produces files in GAMS format. There is also a corresponding GAMS model.

Note that the parser works only for steady state type instances.
